TITAN | Premium Digital Agency Template
!

TITAN is a high-performance, dark-brutalist portfolio template designed for modern digital agencies, creative studios, and elite freelancers. It moves away from the "standard" web experience by utilizing tactile interactions, atmospheric animations, and a tactical interface aesthetic.

🕹️ Interactive Features
The Titan Reticle: A custom-engineered, dual-layer cursor system. It features a solid core dot and a lagging, rotating outer ring that mimics a tactical targeting system.

Shatter-Point Logic: A physics-based click event. Every mouse-down triggers a "shatter" of digital red sparks, providing immediate tactile feedback.

Atmospheric Lightning: Generative SVG lightning strikes that pulse the hero section. The strikes synchronize with CSS brightness filters and text-shadow pulses on the "TITAN" typography.

Artifact Grid: A high-contrast project showcase using GSAP-powered hover scales and mix-blend-mode interactions.
